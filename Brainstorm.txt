# Raw Brainstorm
- Part A
Logistic regression to get benchmark probability

- Part B
Playing with the cutoff prob vs cost to change
The only lever we can pull is the incentive offered to employee
Hours: f(Incentive)
Percent_change: g(Hours) = g(f(Incentive))
substitute equations to get Percent_change: h(Incentive)
Need to maximize (Percent_change * Premium - Incentive)
