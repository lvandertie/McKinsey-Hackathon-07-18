# Raw Brainstorm
------ Part A ------
Logistic regression to get benchmark probability

Potentially look at consolidating Counts of Premium Payment Dates as % of all premiums paid
in each timeframe


------ Part B ------
Playing with the cutoff prob vs cost to change
The only lever we can pull is the incentive offered to employee
Hours: f(Incentive)
Percent_change: g(Hours) = g(f(Incentive))
substitute equations to get Percent_change: h(Incentive)
Need to maximize (Percent_change * Premium - Incentive)

From written notes (to be typed in LaTeX):
Incentive = -400*ln( ln(200/2.706706 * 1/Premium)/3 )

Reality Checks:
Percentages (benchmark + added) cannot be more than 100%
Final Incentive calculation must compute (e.g. Premium might lead to no incentive)
