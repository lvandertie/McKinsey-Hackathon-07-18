# Instructions
Your client is an Insurance company and they need your help in building a model to predict 
the propensity to pay renewal premium and build an incentive plan for its agents to 
maximise the net revenue (i.e. renewals - incentives given to collect the renewals) 
collected from the policies post their issuance.

You have information about past transactions from the policy holders along with their 
demographics. The client has provided aggregated historical transactional data like number
of premiums delayed by 3/ 6/ 12 months across all the products, number of premiums paid, 
customer sourcing channel and customer demographics like age, monthly income and area type.
 
In addition to the information above, the client has provided the following relationships:

Expected effort in hours put in by an agent for incentives provided; and
Expected increase in chances of renewal, given the effort from the agent.
 
Given the information, the client wants you to predict the propensity of renewal collection
 and create an incentive plan for agents (at policy level) to maximise the net revenues 
from these policies.

# Criteria
Your solutions will be evaluated on 2 criteria:

The base probability of receiving a premium on a policy without considering any incentive
The monthly incentives you will provide on each policy to maximize the net revenue 

# Finer Details
Revenue=SUM((renewal_prob_benchmark + renewal_prob_incr) * premium - Incentives_to_worker)
Where renewal_prob_incr returns %prob increase  (equation (a) )
and Incentives_to_worker returns cost to 

(a) Equation for the % improvement in renewal prob vs effort curve: Y = 20*(1-exp(-X/5))
(b) Equation for the effort-incentives curve: Y = 10*(1-exp(-X/400))

# Problem Statement (Summarized)
We need to determine the probability of receiving the premium  if no incentives are applied
and the optimal incentive to offer employees to maximize the revenue on that policy
